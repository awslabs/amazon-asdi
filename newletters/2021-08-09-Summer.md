Hi everyone! Another quarter has passed and I want to share more news with you. There were 9 exciting new weather & climate datasets launched this past quarter. We are also hosting a training seminar on how to use Amazon EKS to create a Python, Dask, and Jupyter environment for environmental data analysis. [Sign up now](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-public-OE-EKS-Earth-2021-reg-event.html) for the session on August 12th. A recording will also be available on Youtube a few weeks afterwards.
