Hi everyone! Another quarter has passed and I want to share more news with you. There were 9 exciting new weather & climate datasets launched this past quarter. We are also hosting a training seminar on how to use Amazon EKS to create a Python, Dask, and Jupyter environment for environmental data analysis. [Sign up now](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-public-OE-EKS-Earth-2021-reg-event.html) for the session on August 12th. A recording will also be available on Youtube a few weeks afterwards.

### AWS Data Exchange Free Datasets for Sustainability

In addition to Open Data Program (ODP) selection, you have access to 400+ free, production quality data products via AWS Data Exchange (ADX). The data available is primarily from public data sources ranging from emission, health care, demographic, governmental, education and weather. *Note – The process to access the data is different than ODP (details below). *

You will find all 400+ products in [the excel sheet here](supporting-files/Free_Non-Trial_Products_on_ADX_Aug_2021.xlsx) which you can sort through to find data of interest. Notable the selection includes:
