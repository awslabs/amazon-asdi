# Code Green:<br>Hacking on Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative datasets

## Hackathon

The Code Green Hackathon is one of two tracks offered during **Code Green: Hacking on Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative datasets** at re:Invent 2019. If you're interested in participating in Code Green but don't want to compete, check out [the workshop](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-asdi/tree/master/code-green/workshop), which will be held concurrently in the same event space.

#### Teams

Hackathon teams can consist of individuals, or groups of two to five. No more than two AWS employees can work on any one team.

#### Projects

The only hard rule for projects, other than following the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct.html), is that they in some way utilize ASDI datasets. Any ASDI dataset can be used, but we encourage you to check out the ASDI [weather](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/weather/) and [climate](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/climate/) datasets. APIs, visualization tools, combinations of datasets into something new - all fair game. Or surprise us!

We only have four hours to work during the event, so participants can start projects and work on them during the course of re:Invent, starting Monday, December 2.

#### Resources

To help you get started you can check out this [overview of suitable climate and weather datasets](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-asdi/tree/master/code-green/datasets). You can view the full selection of eligible datasets on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/sustainability/).

There are also two Jupyter notebooks in the [notebooks section](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-asdi/tree/master/code-green/notebooks) of this repo that have been put together by ASDI, and links to relevant third-party notebooks, to make it easier to get rolling with some of the datasets.

You may find [GDAL library](https://gdal.org/) helpful for working with many of the data sets. It suppo Python, Java, C, and C++ API.

#### Submissions

Entries should be submitted as open-source GitHub repos (try [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/), or use GitHub's default [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)). Feel free to include a video, PowerPoint deck, or other supporting material in your repo.


#### Demos

Teams can work for the full four hours, but time will be set aside at the end for demos.

#### Judging and criteria

Members of the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative, AWS Sustainability, and Solutions Architecture teams will evaluate all entries (regardless of whether they're demoed). Criteria are applicability to sustainability, novel use of data, and technical excellence, in that order.

Judging and notification of winners will take place after the event.

#### Prizes

Code Green is purchasing carbon offsets for travel to re:Invent by all registered hackathon participants--we all win! Annnd... the individual or team selected as the winner by the judges will receive free passes to re:Invent 2020.

The real winner? Earth, of course.
