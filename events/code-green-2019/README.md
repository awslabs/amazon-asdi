## Code Green: Hacking on Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative datasets

Code Green is both a hackathon and workshop, originally created for re:Invent 2019, centered around exploring Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets.

### Hackathon
Individuals—or groups of two to five—can work on projects during the course of re:Invent. Any ASDI dataset can be used, but we encourage you to check out the ASDI [weather](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/weather/) and [climate](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/climate/) datasets. APIs, visualization tools, combinations of datasets into something new - all fair game. Or surprise us!

### Workshop
Want to participate without competing? An ASDI workshop runs concurrently during the event, in which participants build a functioning API to use ASDI datasets to make decisions with sustainability data. Facilitators will be there to help, and code for the workshop will be posted to this repo before the event.
