## Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative

This repo contains docs and supporting material for the [Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/tech-for-good/asdi), an initiative to provide access to large datasets in the cloud to help researchers and innovators address a wide range of sustainability challenges.

## Getting started

[Getting Started with the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)](getting-started-guide.md) has information on accessing the datasets, and an overview of AWS basics for working with data.

## Contributing to ASDI

There are two main ways to contribute to the ASDI Program:

1. If you have sustainability-related data you would like to share with the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), please refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on the Registry of Open Data GitHub repository, or contact us at [sustainability-data-initiative@amazon.com](mailto:sustainability-data-initiative@amazon.com). You may be able to offset the storage and egress costs of your data by submitting an application to the [AWS Public Dataset Program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/public-datasets/). Check [here](https://opendata.aws/guide) for guidance on how to optimally share data in the AWS cloud. Data providers are responsible for maintaining and supporting the data that they share.

2. If you have tutorials, open code, or publications that exemplify how existing ASDI datasets can be used for sustainability related work, you can add them directly to the Registry of Open Data on AWS by clicking the link at the bottom of a dataset page named &#39;Edit this dataset entry on GitHub.&#39; For example see the link at the bottom of [this dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/).

## ASDI data for supporting research

### AWS Cloud Credits for Research

If you would like to test a cloud-based idea for sustainability, consider requesting a cloud grant to offset the costs of experimentation. The [AWS Cloud Credits for Research](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/) program awards grants of AWS credits to support those interested in prototyping new sustainability related solutions on AWS, or transfer existing workflows from on-premise to the cloud. For more information, please refer to the [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/faq/).

### AWS Research Cloud Program

The [AWS Research Cloud Program](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/research-cloud-program/) was built by scientists at AWS to enable easy use of AWS resources by their fellow researchers in the scientific community around the globe. By signing up you can receive a free copy of the AWS Researcher&#39;s Handbook, a comprehensive guide to doing research on AWS.
